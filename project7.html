		  <h2> A person I admire(Past or Present)</h2>
		  <br>
		  <p class="person-description"> A person that I admire is Mike Trout of the Los Angelas Angels of 
		  Anaheim. He is a remarkable athlete and he is very humble about about his 
		  success.<span class="important-point"</span> He plays the game hard every time like it is the last game he
		  is going to play and that just shows the respect that he has for the game
		  and the people that play alongside with him.</p>
